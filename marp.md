First Slide
========================================================

- Mean model not mean measurement
- Multi spiking fits
- Preferred current versus fixed current search.
- optimal still possible despite rastrigrin's function


Speed, Relavence, Smoothness
========================================================

Speed and memory hacks were needed. 
Speed of models, and speed of objective function.

Smoothness needed interrogation, for practical reasons smoothness was contingent on speed.



Models and Data are Readily Distinguishable in a Reduced Dimension Space
========================================================
